This project mainly focused on the development of a mobile application to help
provide an effective online health care service provider. With eConsult, people get
numerous benefits like finding hospital information, contacting their doctor,
checking on the daily Covid-19 updates and do their own Covid-19 test and such
other information. Our project was designed with the online Viber Covid support
made by the Viber team where users can ask relevant questions. Besides, it helps in
their everyday life by providing health care information, Covid-19 FAQ’s and
MythBusters, and also tips and methods to be safe from the virus. This project was
developed on the android platform. We made use of Dart as our core programming
language along with Flutter as cross platform for native mobile apps for UI
development, Android Studio, alongside Visual Studio Code were used as our IDE
and Firebase as our database. We further used API’s for smoother and faster
functioning of the mobile application.
